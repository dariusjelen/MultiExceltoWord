# MultiExceltoWord
Identifies labels in the excel document. Uses excel files from a folder to replace placeholders in word.  Outputs unused labels from 
the excel files to a .txt file.

The file names are placeholders, which explains why they do not work outright. I may in the future upload an example for you to be
able to see how it works.

Libraries to enable:
Visual Basic For Applications (duh);
Microsoft Excel 16.0 Object Library;
OLE Automation;
Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library;
Microsoft Shell Controls And Automation;
Microsoft Scripting Runtime

Would appreciate if you shared how you implemented this into your own project/code.
